Project Overview: Malware Detection and Removal Script

This project involved creating a Python script to detect and delete potentially malicious files based on specific patterns or signatures within the file content. The script employs a simple pattern-matching approach, where it searches for predefined markers that are indicative of malware. If any of these markers are found in a given file, the file is flagged as malicious and automatically deleted. This project was designed to demonstrate a basic malware detection strategy, though it has limitations when dealing with obfuscated malware or false positives.

Project Components:
1. Pattern Matching for Malware Detection: The script reads file content and checks for specific patterns (signatures) that may indicate malicious behavior, such as commands or functions commonly used in malware.
2. File Handling and Deletion: It prompts the user to input a file path, reads the file if it exists, and deletes it if any malicious patterns are found.
3. Error Handling: The script handles errors such as missing files and ensures clear feedback for the user if the file path is incorrect.
4. User Input Validation: The script ensures the user provides an accurate file path, contributing to a user-friendly experience.

This project provided hands-on experience in basic malware detection using pattern matching, showcasing both the strengths and limitations of simple detection techniques while reinforcing file handling and security awareness in Python.
